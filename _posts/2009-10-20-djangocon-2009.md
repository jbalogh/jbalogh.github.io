Long (long!) overdue, here's a bunch of links that point to the good things I
learned at djangocon.


## [Restful Ponies][1]

* Started with a basic REST overview, gets interesting when it shows how you can
  easily expose resources using [Piston][]
* [django-roa][] builds on Piston to give models a basic REST API for free
* [remoteobjects][] is an object-restational mapper that maps objects to REST
  apis on the web.  It's really cool and I'm playing with it for the new
  Bugzilla rest view.

## [Deploying Django][2]

Talks about how they're doing "repeatable, automated, isolated" deployments
using Python tools.  Don't you wish we were rocking this on AMO?

* virtualenv and pip to keep the deployment environment isolated
* fabric to script vcs checkout and installation
* using lightweight tags in git to mark deployment versions
* up *and* down migrations with [South][] to stay safe
* mod_wsgi daemon mode is preferred, fastcgi is cool too

## [Scaling Django][5]

Pownce was serving hundreds of request/sec, thousands of db ops/sec, it can be
done.  It's simple to do automatic caching and invalidation when your queries
are going through the ORM, Django's signals decouple the invalidation process
from your update code.  Using multiple databases with Django is not
straightforward, but it's getting easier with an SoC project that's ready to
merged in.

* [sqlparse][] pretty prints SQL queries

## [The Realtime Web][6]

Showed how they created an IRC client in the browser over comet with Django on
the backend.  The browser and the app keep "persistent" connections to an
[orbited][] server that handles all the messy details so the app can pretend
it's really connected directly to the browser.

This coincided with the release of FriendFeed's [Tornado][] web server, which
led to an interesting focus on async during the conference.

## [Using Django in Non-Standard Ways][3]

Covers a lot of little hurdles that people might consider show-stoppers when
using Django, how to overcome them.  WSGI middleware is fun:

* repoze.bitblt: automatically scales images
* repoze.squeeze: Merges JS/CSS automatically based on statistical analysis
* repoze.profile:  Aggregates Python profiling data across all requests, and
  provides an html frontend for viewing the data
* repoze.slicer: extract/filter pieces of an html response

## [Pinax Tutorial][4]

Pinax tries to be a collection of reusable apps that work well together, but it
looks like you spend more time trying to configure things than actually making
useful apps.
