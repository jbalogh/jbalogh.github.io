[pyquery](http://pyquery.org/) is a fantastic little library for dealing with
XML and HTML documents.  It brings the power and ease of jQuery into Python,
letting you deal with CSS selectors and functions instead of a clunky DOM.  I
try to avoid dealing with XML as much as possible, but slinging around pyquery
almost makes XML fun.

## Building lxml
The hardest part of working with pyquery is getting it installed.  pyquery gets
all of its XML power from [lxml][], which has a reputation for being difficult.
[Ian Bicking][] mentioned that lxml2.2 has become much easier to install by
providing an option to compile the troublesome C libs as static libraries,
which has avoided any problems for me.  All you need to do is define
`STATIC_DEPS=true` in the build environment:

    STATIC_DEPS=true pip install pyquery

This has worked for me on OS X with `pip`, `easy_install`, `buildout`, and
probably anything else based on `distutils`.

## Web Scraping
Web scraping is ridiculously easy with pyquery.  Grabbing a [Shakespearean
insult][3] from the web is as simple as

    import pyquery

    p = pyquery.PyQuery('http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/Shaker/')
    insult = p('font').text()

Finding the insult on that page is aided by the author's semantic `font` tag.

## Testing
I like to make sure that my views are working correctly, another task in which
I'm finding pyquery indispensable.  I've seen regexen used for the same task,
but examining a real DOM is much more resilient than trying to pick out pieces
by matching strings.  Testing views is especially useful when dealing with
template systems like Django's and Jinja's which silently hide errors instead
of raising exceptions.

    assert d('#stats').text() == '5 tests: +2 -3'

I've noticed that testing the HTML in this manner has improved my semantic
markup.  Pulling out and testing pieces of the page forces me to add meaningful
ids and classes to the elements.

## Bonus
For extra HTML goodness, the tests submit response pages to the [w3c
Validator][4] using this [multipart form encoder][5].  Then, of course, I use
pyquery to make sure all is well.

    validator = post_multipart('validator.w3.org', '/check',
                               {'fragment': response.data})
    assert pyquery.PyQuery(validator)('#congrats')
