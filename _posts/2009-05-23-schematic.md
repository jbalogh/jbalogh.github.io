title: The worst schema versioning system, ever?

tags: [python, sql, migration]

[schematic][] talks to your database over stdin on the command line.  Thus, it
supports all DBMSs that have a command line interface and doesn't care what
programming language you worship.  Win!

It only looks for files in the same directory as itself so you should put this
script, settings.py, and all migrations in the same directory.

Configuration is done in `settings.py`, which should look something like:

    # How to connect to the database
    db = 'mysql --silent -p blam -D pow'
    # The table where version info is stored.
    table = 'schema_version'

It's python so you can do whatever crazy things you want, and it's a separate
file so you can keep local settings out of version control.

Migrations are just sql in files whose names start with a number, like
`001-adding-awesome.sql`.  They're matched against `'^\d+'` so you can put
zeros in front to keep ordering in `ls` happy, and whatever you want after the
migration number, such as text describing the migration.

[schematic][] creates a table (named in settings.py) with one column, that
holds one row, which describes the current version of the database.  Any
migration file with a number greater than the current version will be applied
to the database and the version tracker will be upgraded.  The migration and
version bump are performed in a transaction.

The version-tracking table will initially be set to 0, so the 0th migration
could be a script that creates all your tables (for reference).  Migration
numbers are not required to increase linearly.

[schematic][] doesn't pretend to be intelligent. Running migrations manually
without upgrading the version tracking will throw things off.

Tested on sqlite any mysql.

NOTE: any superfluous output, like column headers, will cause an error.  On
mysql, this is fixed by using the `--silent` parameter.

Things that might be nice: downgrades, running python files.
